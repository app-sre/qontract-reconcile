    This is the base class for all jobs that will be managed by the
    K8sJobController.

    A job needs to implement the following methods:
    - name_prefix: return the prefix of the job name. This is useful to group
        jobs of the same type together. The prefix is part of the final job name.

    - unit_of_work_identity: return the data that uniquely identifies the unit
        of work that the job will perform. This data will be used to calculate a
        hash that will be used as part of the job name. This way a unit of work
        can be uniquely identified by the job name.

    - job_spec: return the job spec that will be used as the spec part of
        the Kubernetes Job.

    The job can optionally also implement the following methods:
    - annotations: return a dictionary with the annotations that will be used
        in the job metadata.
    - labels: return a dictionary with the labels that will be used in the job
        metadata.
    - build_job: return the V1Job object that will be used to create the job in
        Kubernetes. Override this method if you need to customize the job that
        will represent your unit of work in Kubernetes.
    - name: return the name of the job. Override this method if you need to
        customize the name of the job that will represent your unit of work in
        Kubernetes. Keep in mind that the name of the job is used to identify job
        and the controllers concurrency policy functionality is based on the job name.
