        """
        ChangeTypeV1 are attached to bundle files, react to changes within
        them and use their context to derive who can approve those changes.
        Extracting this context can be done in two ways depending on the configuration
        of the ChangeTypeV1.

        direct context extraction
          If a ChangeTypeV1 defines a `context_schema`, it can be attached to files
          of that schema. If such a file changes, the ChangeTypeV1 feels responsible
          for it in subsequent diff coverage calculations and will use the approvers
          that exist in the context of that changed file. This is the default
          mode almost all ChangeTypeV1 operate in.

          Example: a ChangeTypeV1 defines `/openshift/namespace-1.yml` as the
          context_schema and can cover certain changes in it. If this ChangeTypeV1
          is attached to certain namespace files (potential BundleChanges) and
          a Role (context), changes in those namespace files can be approved by
          members of the role.

        context detection
          If a ChangeTypeV1 additionally defines change_schemas and context selectors,
          it has the capability to differentiate between reacting to changes
          (and trying to cover them) and finding the context where approvers are
          defined.

          Example: Consider the following ChangeTypeV1 granting permissions to
          approve on new members wanting to join a role.
          ```
            $schema: /app-interface/change-type-1.yml

            contextType: datafile
            contextSchema: /access/roles-1.yml

            changes:
            - provider: jsonPath
              changeSchema: /access/user-1.yml
              jsonPathSelectors:
              - roles[*]
              context:
                selector: roles[*].'$ref'
                when: added
          ```

          Users join a role by adding the role to the user. This means that it
          is a /access/user-1.yml file that changes in this situation. But permissions
          to approve changes should be attached to the role not the user. This
          ChangeTypeV1 takes care of that differentiation by defining /access/role-1.yml
          as the context schema (making the ChangeTypeV1 assignable to a role)
          but defining change detection on /access/user-1.yml via the `changeSchema`.
          The actual role can be found within the userfile by looking for `added`
          entries under `roles[*].$ref` (this is a jsonpath expression) as defined
          under `context.selector`.
