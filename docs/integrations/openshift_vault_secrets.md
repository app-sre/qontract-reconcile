# Manage Secrets via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`) using Vault

Instructions:

1. Create a secret in Vault with the data (key-value pairs) that should be applied to the cluster.
  * The value of each key in the secret in Vault should **NOT** be base64 encoded.
  * If you wish to have the value base64 encoded in Vault, the field key should be of the form `<key_name>_qb64`.
2. Add a reference to the secret in Vault under the `openshiftResources` section of a namespace file with the following attributes:

- `provider`: must be `vault-secret`.
- `path`: absolute path to secret in Vault. Note that it should **NOT** start with `/`.
- `version`: version of secret in Vault.
- `name`: (optional) name of the Kubernetes Secret object to be created. Overrides the name of the secret in Vault.
- `labels`: (optional) labels to add to the Secret.
- `annotations`: (optional) annotations to add to the Secret.
- `type`: (optional) type of the Kubernetes Secret to be created. Defaults to `Opaque` if not specified.

3. In order to change one or more values in a Kubernetes Secret, update the secret in Vault first and submit a new MR with the updated `version` field.
  * Versioned secrets in Vault require a KV v2 secret engine.
  * The current version can be found in Vault on the top-right of the list of values for your secret.

Notes:

* [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) with fields of type `stringData` are not supported.
* When creating a new secret in Vault, be sure to set the `Maximum Number of Versions` field to `0` (unlimited).
* If you want to delete a secret from Vault, please get in contact with the App-SRE team.
* If you wish to use a different secrets engine, please get in contact with the App-SRE team.
* To create a secret in a `production` environment, please get in contact with the App-SRE team.

Example:

This secret in Vault:
```
{
  "key": "value",
  "otherkey_qb64": "dmFsdWUy"
}
```
Would generate this Kubernetes Secret:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
data:
  key: dmFsdWU=
  otherkey: dmFsdWUy
type: Opaque
```
