# qontract-reconcile

A tool to reconcile services with their desired state as defined in App-Interface.
In addition, e2e tests are available to detect potential problems reconciling services with their desired state.
Additional tools that use the libraries created by the reconciliations are also hosted here.

### e2e-tests

- `create-namespace`: A test to create a namespace and verify that required `RoleBinding`s are created as well to be able to reconcile them.
- `dedicated-admin-rolebindings`: A test to verify that all required namespaces have the required `RoleBinding`s to be able to reconcile them.

### tools

- `app-interface-reporter`: Creates service reports and submits PR to App-Interface.
- `qontract-cli`: A cli tool for qontract (currently very good at getting information).

## Usage

Use [config.toml.example](config.toml.example) as a template to create a `config.toml` file.

Run a reconcile integration like this:

```sh
qontract-reconcile --config config.toml --dry-run <subcommand>

# review output and run without `--dry-run` to perform actual changes
qontract-reconcile --config config.toml <subcommand>
```

> Note: you can use the `QONTRACT_CONFIG` environment variable instead of using `--config`.

## OpenShift usage

OpenShift templates can be found [here](/openshift/qontract-reconcile.yaml). In order to add integrations there please use the [helm](/helm/README.md) chart provided.

## Installation

This project targets Python version 3.9.x for best compatibility. Verify the Python3 version that your shell is using with `python3 --version`. You can optionally use a tool like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python versions on your computer.

Create and enter the [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# make sure you are running the latest setuptools
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

Install the package:

```sh
pip install .

# or use this for development mode so rebuild/reinstall isn't necessary after 
# each change that is made during development
pip install -e .

# optionally install all test/type dependencies - useful when writing tests,
# auto-completion in your IDE, etc.
pip install -r ./requirements/requirements-dev.txt
```

If the commands above don't work maybe you need to install the `python-devel` and `gcc-c++` packages.
You may also need need to first [install a rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) ([Mac OS directions](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Rust/)) and then run `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools_rust`.

### Requirements

Please see [setup.py](setup.py).

All requirements files are gathered in [./requirements/](./requirements).
It consists of:

- [requirements-test.txt](requirements/requirements-test.txt) for unit test and linting dependencies
- [requirements-type.txt](requirements/requirements-type.txt) for type checking dependencies
- [requirements-format.txt](requirements/requirements-format.txt) for formatting dependencies
- [requirements-dev.txt](requirements/requirements-dev.txt) installs all above mentioned dependencies

### Image build

In order to speed up frequent builds and avoid issues with dependencies, docker image makes use
[`qontract-reconcile-build`](https://quay.io/repository/app-sre/qontract-reconcile-base?tag=latest&tab=tags)
image. See [`app-sre/coontainer-images`](https://github.com/app-sre/container-images) repository
if you want to make changes to the base image. This repo [`Dockerfile`](dockerfiles/Dockerfile)
must only contain instructions related to the python code build.

## CI Tooling

This project uses [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for running 
tests, linting/static analysis, and type checkers. Some of the more common 
commands have been provided below, but see the tox docs for more complete 
documentation.

Running all checks (tests, linting, and type checkers):

```
tox
```

To run the checks faster (run in parallel):

```
tox -p
```

Running specific checks (can be much faster):

```
# Only run unit tests using Python 3.6
tox -e py36

# Only run linters
tox -e lint

# Only run the type checker
tox -e type

# Look at tox.ini for usage of posargs, this allows us to override which 
# options are passed to the CLI where it's being used. This can be helpful 
# for type checking a specific file, or running a subset of unit tests (this  
# can be even faster).
tox -e type -- reconcile/utils/slack_api.py
```

## Run reconcile loop for an integration locally in a container

 This is currently only tested with the docker container engine.

### Prepare config.toml

Make sure the file `./config.dev.toml` exists and contains your current configuration.
Your `config.dev.toml` should point to the following qontract-server address:

```
[graphql]
server = "http://host.docker.internal:4000/graphql"
```

### Run qontract-server

Start the [qontract-server](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-server) in a different window, e.g., via:

```
qontract-server$ make dev
```

### Trigger integration

```
make dev-reconcile-loop INTEGRATION_NAME=terraform-resources DRY_RUN=--dry-run INTEGRATION_EXTRA_ARGS=--light SLEEP_DURATION_SECS=100
```

## Query Classes

We use [qenerate](https://github.com/app-sre/qenerate) to generate data classes for GQL queries.
GQL definitions and generated classes can be found [here](reconcile/gql_definitions/).

### Workflow

1. Define your query or fragment in a `.gql` file somewhere in `reconcile/gql_definitions`.
2. Every gql file must hold exactly one `query` OR `fragment` definition. You must not have multiple definitions within one file.
3. Do not forget to add `# qenerate: plugin=pydantic_v1` in the beginning of the file. This tells `qenerate` which plugin is used to render the code.
4. Have an up-to-date schema available at localhost:4000
5. `make gql-introspection` gets the type definitions. They will be stored in `reconcile/gql_definitions/introspection.json`
6. `make gql-query-classes` generates the data classes for your queries and fragments

## Troubleshooting

`faulthandler` is enabled for this project and SIGUSR1 is registered to dump the traceback. To do so, you can use `kill -USR1 pid` where pid is the ID of the qontract-reconcile process.

## Code style guide

Qontract-reconcile uses [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as the code style guide.
The style is enforced via [PR checks](#ci-tooling) with the help of the following utilities:

* [Black - The uncompromising code formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Isort - sort your imports](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)
* [Flake8: Your Tool For Style Guide Enforcement](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
* [Pylint - a static code analyser](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

Run `make format` before you commit your changes to keep the code compliant.

## Release

Release version are calculated from git tags of the form X.Y.Z.
- If the current commit has such a tag, it will be used as is
- Otherwise the latest tag of that format is used and:
  - the patch label (Z) is incremented
  - the string `.pre<count>+<commitid>` is appended. `<count>` is the number of commits since the X.Y.Z tag. `<commitid> is... the current commitid.

After the PR is merged, a CI job will be triggered that will publish the package to pypi: https://pypi.org/project/qontract-reconcile.
